Introduction
============
The core_utilities python package was written to provice a develop or general user
with functionality to accomplish many common tasks such as reading files, plotting
data, and providing an interface between the python interpretor and a command line
interface.  Many of the functions within this package are available in other packages;
however, this software suite attempts to unify them under one roof

The Command Line Interface can be found in the OSUtilities class in the 
``operating_system`` package.  The file reading functions can be found in
the ``file_readers`` module, and the plotting functions can be found in the ``plotting``
package.
